### App architecture and code style
The app is over five years old and has evolved over time. There is some code that needs to be executed on every update to ensure that users migrating from older versions of the app can keep their tokens and data intact. Currently, the app uses Room and EncryptedSharedPreferences for persistence, but it used to use ObjectBox and SecurePreferences. We still see users updating 2FAS from very old versions, so we need to keep these libraries in the app.

The app is partially modularized by feature layers. The older parts of the app are written in classic MVP + RxJava, while the latest features use MVVM with Jetpack Compose and Coroutines. Because of this "hybrid" structure with two different async frameworks, some use cases have had to be duplicated or wrapped with additional layers. The main goal is to refactor the app step by step to match the latest Google standards (using the NIA app as an example):

- Migrating all screens to Compose and MVVM
- Using Jetpack Navigation and a single activity
- Implementing the Material 3 theme
- Replacing RxJava with Coroutines
- Adding unit and UI tests for crucial parts of the app


### Project setup
1. Create your own debug signing key in `config/debug_signing.jks` (example below)
2. Create `config/config.properties` file with your debug key alias and password:
```
debug.storePassword=
debug.keyAlias=
debug.keyPassword=
```
3. Comment out (`//`) `id("com.google.gms.google-services")` and `id("com.google.firebase.crashlytics")` plugins in `app/build.gradle.kts`. Also comment out `FirebaseCrashlytics.getInstance().setCrashlyticsCollectionEnabled(sendCrashLogsPreference.get())` in `app/src/main/java/com/twofasapp/App.kt`. This is needed to disable Firebase services (we do not share `google-services.json` in the repository) and to prevent the app from crashing on startup due to uninitialized Firebase.

We've tested the build process on Java 17.

#### Example signing key generation

You can use the commands below to generate a sample signing keystore and create `config.properties`.

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore config/debug_signing.jks -storepass android -alias androiddebugkey -keypass android -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -dname "C=US, O=Android, CN=Android Debug"
cat >config/config.properties <<EOF
debug.storePassword=android
debug.keyAlias=androiddebugkey
debug.keyPassword=android
EOF
```
